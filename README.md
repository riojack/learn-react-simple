# learn-react-simple
Demonstrates a simple, test-driven React UI without Flux pattern or Redux.

## Principles

1. All code is test-driven.
2. Demonstrates CRUD operations.
3. Stays away from Flux pattern and Redux, preferring simple, working software.
4. Clean and clear commits.
5. Assumes the reader is new to all technologies used in this project.

## References

Obviously, I use Git as a version control system.  You are encouraged to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) or clone this project and use it for your own projects.

I use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to keep the whitespace consistent regardless of the editor used.  See the `.editorconfig` file.

I use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage the version installed on a given computer.  Right now, I prefer Node 5 and NPM 3, though there's nothing saying it won't work on Node 4.  The `package.json` file specifies at least Node 4.  For Windows users NPM version 3 is preferable since it flattens `node_modules` as much as possible, which can help speed up deleting `node_modules`.
